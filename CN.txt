-> what is computer network?
--> a computer network is a collection of interconnected device or computing device or digital device  which are communicate over the network.
--> diff diff device sharing the resource over the network
--> computer , printer , scanner, switch or router or hub or firewall or other device are connected to each other

what is internet ?
--> internet is a network of network (interconnected network)
--> collection of network
--> one types of world wide web


types of computer network? 

-> lan (local area network)  --> small device are interconnect --> used in collage or office
-> pan (personal area network)  --> small device like mobile laptop , bluetuth are connected used in house
-> man (metropolitan area network)  --> collection of lan (used in state level)
-> wan (wide area network)    --> collection of interconnected man (used in netional level)

what is network ?
  --> it's a connection between diff devices  and communication is done over the network     ============> by using ip network comm is done over the network
--> A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources and communicate over the network

--> in simple term if more then 2 device is connect and sharing some information or resouce over the network then we can said that this is network

--> what is a different between hub , switch and router ?
--> those all are a connecting device in com network
--> by using those device the network is connected or device is conneceted 
--> those all are binding device
--> those all are physical level device 

hub --> connect 2 device or more  --> connect small device or computer  --> filtering is not possible  ---> data passed in form of bits
switch --> connect 2 lan or more   --> connect small network   -> filtering is possible --> more effective then hub  --> data passed in form of frames
router --> connect 2 network or more  --> connect large network  --> highly effective filtering possible  --> data passed in form of packet

--> what is filtering in computer network?
--> Packet filtering is the process of passing or blocking data packets at a network interface by a firewall based on source and destination addresses, ports or protocols.
--> based on some predefine rules the those device is allow to access the network by using ip add or port or any keyword
--> basic means that allow to access based on some conditon to access the network
--> simple term that is one types of security gaurd
--> which req is allow and which req is denied is based on filtering process


what is link ??

==> it's a connection b/t devices (binding device)
--> a link may be a wired or wireless linked b/w diff device
--> wired connection may be used physical cables , hub or switch
--> wireless connection may router or wireless access point

what is node in network?
--> it's a physical device which can send and recive a data or information
-=> it's a physical level devices 

what is backbone network?
--> a backbone network is a network which is interconnect to diff part of network --> it's a main network which is responsible to handle whole network
--> one types of parent network which is care about interconnceted network

what is network topology ?
--> the physical arrangement of a com device in a network is called network topology
--> it's a arrangement of device in network

diff types of topology is used in com network ?
--> point to point topology
--> mesh top..
--> star top
--> bus top
--> ring top
--> tree top
--> hybrid top

what is lan ?
local area network
--> it's contain small area 
--> it may be wired or wiredless
--> used on college or office



what is routers ?
--> those are connecting devices used over the network to connecting 2 or more then 2 network
--> used for data packat filtering

what is point to point network ?
--> it's refer to physical connection between 2 nodes 
--> nodes may be a com or scanner or server or anything physical devices
--> it's a direct connection
--> connection is must be  a physical

--> may be not physical link is used
example : remote and tv is connected by using wireless connection 

---> what is OSI model ?
--> OSI means open system interconnection
==> it's a universal model based on computer network function
--> all the function is define by OSI model 
--> define all the functionality or function which is perform over the network
--> gives basic idea about flow of process which is done over the network
--> define the standard functionality of network layes

it's has 7 layer and each layer is define the functionality itself

--> applicaton layer  --> data
--> presantation layer  --> data
--> seasion layer  --> data
--> transport layer --> segment , datagram
--> network layer   --> packet
--> data link layer   --> frames
--> physical layer  --> bit

===> what is anonymous FTP?
==> by using which user can access a services of server without give identity to it 
--> services is publicly available to all the user 
===> suppose there is server and i am a browser and i want to access the services of that server than without giving my identity to server i can access the data of server



what is TCP/IP model ?
--> it's a new network model and based on OSI model
each layer define the protocols where in osi each layer defie the functionality
==> now everywhere com network is follow tcp/ip model

=============> ip protocol is connection less protocol

--> what is http protocol ? which port number is used ?
--> Hypertext Transfer Protocol
==> used port number 80
--> allow for communication over the network
--> it's a stateless protocol
==> conncetionless


--> http pro --> define the format of message and how message is transferd
--> application protocol

--> what is NAT ?
=> network address translation
--> it is used for translate the private ip add into public ip add and vise versa
by using which we can effectively used the ip add --> bcz the length of ip add is 32 bit and number of user are lots ... to give each and every device unique ip add is not possible without net


----------> can diff device have same ip add ?
---> no normaly not possible 
---> but by using a NAT device this is possible


ipv4 --> 32 bit
ipv6 --> 128 bit

what is TCP ?
transmision control protocol --> used in transport layer
---> it's a connection orianted protocol
--> used when communication is there between 2 system

--> first of all connection is established then after the communication is done
--> used for established the connection and maintain the connection b/w system
--> reliable protocol (either 0% or 100% comm)  give gerenty that 100% data transfer

-->


what is UDP?
user datagram protocol --> used in transport layer
---> it's a connectionless protocol
--> without create a connection or established a connection comm is done
--> used when communication is there between 2 system
-> less reialbe 


what is firewall ?
A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic. 
Accept : allow the traffic Reject : block the traffic but reply with an “unreachable error” Drop : block the traffic with no reply A firewall establishes a barrier between secured internal networks and outside untrusted network, such as the Internet.

internal network --- firewall ---- external network
secure network <=====> firewall <====> unsecure network


what is DOS attack ?
--> denied of services
--> one types of attack in which multiple req is occures on target machine or server so that authenticate used cannot access the services of server ---> mainly used for put down the reputation of company
--> increace the overload on the server

--> ASCII
american standrad code for information iterchange


what is mac add ?
media access control
==========> The physical address -- which is also called a media access control, or MAC, address -- identifies a device to other devices on the same local network. The internet address -- or IP address -- identifies the device globally. A network packet needs both addresses to get to its destination.

without ip add the communication is done ?
==> yes it is possible by using mac add in same network

--> in local network(if all devices in same network) mac add is used for idenitfy a devices uniquely 

---> but in internet or world ip add is req to identify uniqaly

---> what is DNS ?
domain name system 
--> used for convert ip add into domain name and vise versa
--> it's has a tree like structures in which all the process is done
--> make our likes easy 
--> mapping is done between ip add and domain name 

req ===> goes to root server ==> conutry level server (.in , .edu, .com) ==> low level in which actual content is there 
one resolver is used for reslove the actual req in DNS

--> DHCP ==> dynamic host configuration protocols
--> ICMP --> internet contol message protocols

---> ping ---> it's a command or program to check that req is reached to the destination and it's agives the reply successfully

==> ethernet is nothing but connect a device by physically using wired or cable
