DBMS ::

DBMS stand for database management system 
--> dbms is used for store and manage a data into computer system.
--> dbms is used for storing a data , manupilation of data and also used for orgenized data in structure or unstrucuter way.

--> there are 2 types of dbms is there :
--> 1 is nosql DBMS  --> non relational database --> mongodb , hbase , cassandra
--> 2 SQL DBMS   --> relational database --> mysql , oracle


2 write sql statement to create a table 

--> CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME ( id int NOTNULL , name varchar(50) , age number);


3  what is foreign key ?

--> this is a key which is define the relationship between different different relation or table in dbms

in one table this key is refer as a primary key and that only key is refer in another table as a foreign key.

--> this foreign key is linked between diff table 
--> this key is a key which is used to link two tables toghether.


4 difference between primary key and unique key ?

primary key ---> table can have only one primary key --> null value cannot allow   --> you cannot change or delete the value of primary key
unique key --> table can have multiple unique key  --> we can store one null value   --> you can change or delete the value of unique key


5 what is the defference between delete , truncate , and drop ?

---> delete --> command is used for delete a one or more row based on condition.
--> truncate --> this command is used for delete the data of table not table is delete , schema of table is not deleted.
--> drop --> this command is used for delete a tbale and database , schema is also removed.


6 what is diffrent types of lang is availabe in dbms ?


--> ddl --> data defination lang --> used for create table or database and define the schema. --> CREATE , DROP , ALTER , RENAME 
--> DML --> data manipulation lang --> used for manupilation of data --> update , delete , insert
--> DCL --> data control lang ---> command is used for define the control and permision lang on database or table --> grant , revoke 
--> DQL --> data query lang --> used for access the data of table --> select

7 what is the diff between union and union all ?
--> ---> both are used between 2 or more tables.

--> union --> duplicate rows is not allow when access a data from diff table 
--> union all --> duplicate rows allow when access a data from diff table.
example --> select id from dhaval union select id from dev.

8 what is the ACID property in DBMS ?
--> A - atomicity , c - consistancy , i - isolation , d - durability 

--> atomicity --> relible transfer (either 100% or 0%)
--> consistancy --> data must unique and identical or data must be contant 
--> isolation --> transaction is done indepenetant , multiple tranaction is happed without interfir in one another , one transction is invisible to another 
--> durability --> any changes is done then it will be change permanant in database,  after the commit 

9 what are diff types of relationship in dbms ?
one to one 
one to many 
many to one 
many to many
