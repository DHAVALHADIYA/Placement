DSA <====================>

1 why data stucture is used ? why do you learn data structures ? what's the benefits of it?

-->  DSA provides algorithams by using which you can solve your problem in effiecene way
--> used to store and manage your data using dsa
--> ds is used in real life everywhere 
--> used for solve real world problem
--> play crusiol role for solving real world problem

Data Structures are necessary for designing efficient algorithms.
it is also used for building a effiecnce algorithm
Using appropriate data structures can help programmers save a good amount of time while performing operations such as storage, retrieval, or processing of data.
Manipulation of large amounts of data is easier.

for example ::--> binary search algorithm

2 what is data structure
--> it's not a programming lang
--> it is used with programming lang

--> it's a just concept to manage and store your data in efficience way
--> also DS define the relationship b/w different data

--> DS is set of algorithms
