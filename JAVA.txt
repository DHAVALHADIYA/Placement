JAVA

1 what is jit?
--> jit means just in time used with JVM for effiencncy increase execution
--> JIT is comipler used in java 
--> is there is multiple number of call for same function then by using JVM again and again comipler run it so performance is down
--> JIT is used with JVM and its a complier used in java


2 what is classloader 
-> it's a first file which is load whenever we run any java program
-> classloader is integreated with JVM
-> whenever java program want to run then classloader is load java program into JVM for execution

3 which types of memory allocation is available in java ?

             ->>>>>>>> 1 class memory 2 heap memory 3 stack memory

4 static public void main () this fun is run ? after exchange position in this way ?
  --> yes it will run  bcz there is not order is specify for access specifiar (order is not important for access specifiar)

5 what is default value stored in local variable?

--> The local variables do not have any default values in Java.
--> if we try to access that var which is only declare not defined then it will give an error.

--> but for globle var it will be null or 0 or 0.0 depend on var types 

6 import java.util.*;

public class arrayclone {

    static public void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("dhaval" + 100 + 100); // output is dhaval100100
        System.out.println(100 + 100 + "dhaval"); // 200dhaval
    }

}
  ---> int + double = double
  --> int + string = string

        System.out.println("dhaval" - 100 - 100); // it will give an error
        System.out.println(100 - 100 + "dhaval");  // 0dhaval

7 what is an association in java
   ---> diff b/t inheritance and association  

   -------> both are used for define a relationship between differeance classes in java 
 
--> association means relationship or connection between two diff classes in java (has a relation)  --> farari car has a engine and breaksystem (engine and breaksystem)      

inheritance also define a relaitonship between two different class ( is a relation)  for example -----> a farari car is a car (2 class for one is farari and another is car)

8 what is copy constructor

---> copy constructor is constructor in which object of that class is pass as argument for initialsed value of that class 

class is dhaval----> dhaval(dhaval obj)--> initialised value of class

    example -->

class Person {
	private String name;
	private int age;

	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}

	public Person(Person another) {
		this(another.name, another.age);
	}

	// Getters and setters for the instance variables
}
    ---> in psvm---> obj1 is passed in person 

--> copy of one constructor is passed as an argument to another constructor 

9    what is marker interface in java

--? an interface without body or interface which is an empty is called marker interface

10 what is an object cloning

--> to create a new object which is similar to that object and has a same functionality of that object 
--> it's a process to creating a new object from exiting object which has same functionality and it a simiar to that object

--> clone() built in fun is provided by java for cloning a object 

11 java is pure or complate object orianted programming ? justify ans ?

---> no java is not pure oop ---> bcz in java used static key word with method or var---> so using that keyword without any object creation we can called any var or method
--> but in pure oop it's only based on object ----> everything in pure oop is an object

--> Smalltalk is a lang which is pure oop

12 what is wrapper class in java ?
---> A Wrapper class in Java is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types
---> all primitive data types have wrapper class in java
---> obj of that wrapper class contain a value of primitive data types

13 define singleton class ?
--> a class which have only one object is called singleton class 

--> when you define a constructor of class as private then you can create only one object of that class   --> define there var value
if we create a multiple obj of that singleton class then all the obj is refer to same add in heap

14 what is package in class 
--> package is nothing but collection of diff classes and interface and all library
--> interface is nothing but similar to class 
--> it's represent a tree like hirachchry stucture like fs
--> similar to file system

15 pointer are used in java ?
--> pointer are special types of variable used for refer a address of another var
--> not used   -> JVM is take care of memory management in java  --> you can't access a memory directly in java 

16 difference between instance and object
---> instance and object both are same in java

17 difference between instance var and local var in java ?
---> instance var is an object of that class  ---> obj contain a ref value of that class
---> local var is a variable define in block or method or class which contain value of primitive data types

18 what is java string pool

--> string pool is availble in java heap memory
--> string pool contain collection of string
--> if we create a new string and the value is avilable in that string pool then that new string also refer to that exiting string otherwise new string is created

19 what is exception

--> exception is a unwanted event which is occurs during the runtime or executin time and stop flow of execution of program 

--> solve by using try catch or finally keyword...

20 what is final keyword in java ?

--> final keyword is predefine keyword used in java
--> if we make a variable as a final then thourghout the program we cannot change the value of that var

21 what happend if main method is not static ?

--> the program will give an error bcz the main method is a first one which is run first or called first when program is run and
 if the main method is not static then without create an object of main method we can't access it so that why it qill give an error
--> first time if main method is not called than not any other method is called and without any object not any non static method will called


22 is this possible that there is multiple main method is there?
yes is this possible that there is multiple main method is there in program ---> but one condition that both method must have differenet parameter or different return types


23 without main method your program is run ?

no without any main method program is not run -> it will give an error

24 what is jdk?
--> java developement kit ---> it's a used for develop any java program
-> JDK = JVM + JRE + LIBRARY + TOOLS + JIT
--> it is one types of package 

25 access specifiar 
--> define access level or scope of var or method or class or constructor 
--> used for implement a encapsulation
--> default , private , protected , public
-> public --> everywhere
--> default --> inside package same
--> private -> in same class
--> protected --> same package everywhere --> different package by using inheritence

26 can constructor return any value ?
--> no constructor cannot return any thing bcz in it's delcaration we cannot define any retun type
--> implicitly it will return current instace or object of class but explicitly it will not return anything

27 this keyword in java ?
--> this keyword in java is a special reserved keyword 
--> it is refer to current object of class
--> it is a refernce keyword
-> it is refer to current class --> method or var or constructor
--> it is refer to var or method or constru or instace of that class

why this keyword is used ??
==> to remove a confusion
b/t class var and local var of constructor

28 super keyword?
--> similar to this also refrence keyword
-> super keyword is refer to superclass of a class in which super keyword is used
--> used for called a constructor of super class
--> The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects
--> super keyword if refer to super class
using super keyword we can access a var or method or con of super class

29 can we overload a static method ?
--> yes we can

30 what is dynamic method dispatch

--> it's a late binding process where the method is called at runtime or executed at runtime
--> A and B is class and B is inheritence class  A 

if A ab = new B(); we used this then this is called dynamic mathod dispatch

method overriden is called at runtime 

-> also called as run time polymorphism

31 delete is faster in linked list then array ?
yes is this true in linkedlist we only have to delate a a connection 
but in array if we dlt any element then left shift of other element is req

32 what is thread in java ?
--> thread in java is a direction or a path using which we can  executed our program.
in each program at least one thread is there that is main method

-> thread is a direction or path for program execution

each and every program has atleast one thread

33 life cycle of thread 
--> create , runnable , running , blocked , dead

34 the next() method of iterator throws concurrentmodificationexception in java 

35  Collections.unmodifiableList(list);  ==> The Collections.unmodifiableList() method in Java is used to create an unmodifiable view of the specified List. An unmodifiable list is a list that cannot be modified (elements cannot be added, removed, or changed), but the underlying original list can still be modified.
 the unmodifiableList variable is an unmodifiable view of the mutableList. If you attempt to modify unmodifiableList, it will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. However, you can still modify the original mutableList.

36 java.util  ====> package contains all the collection classes

37 ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe implementation of the Map
---> deadlock is there in it

38 Java 5 ===> concurrent collection is introduced

39 java 21 is new version of java ==> letest version of java

40 Which of the following keywords is used for throwing exception manually? Explanation: “throw' 

41 Which of these keywords must be used to monitor for exceptions? ==> try

42  Exception handling is managed via 5 keywords – try, catch, throws, throw and finally.

43 throw keyword is used for manually throw or generate error 

44 if by using try block exception is already handle by catch block then not need to write another catch block ==> otherwise it will give an error

45 Which of these is method for testing whether the specified element is a file or a directory? Explanation: isFile() 

46 The clear() method of java. nio. ByteBuffer Class is used to clear this buffer

47 for working with stream inputstream and outputstream classess is used 

48 so hash code of null will always be 0

49 hashmap you can put null value and it's hashcode is 0

50 java hashmap , hashset is not syncronized

51 print() and println() are defined under the class PrintStream

52 The java.io package is used to handle input and output operations

53 , streams are used for input and output operations.

54  AWT stands for Abstract Window Toolkit.

55 bydefault int var value is 0

56 There are three properties in the Thread class related to priority: MAX_PRIORITY : The maximum value is 10, kown as the maximum priority of a thread. NORM_PRIORITY : The normal value is 5, known as the normal priority of a thread. MIN_PRIORITY : The minimum value is 1, known as the minimum priority of a thread.

57 thread are indepenedent

58  The instanceOf operator in java works on a simple is-a relationship.

59 getChars() method copies the content of this string into a specified char array.

60 StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning its methods are thread-safe and can be safely used in a multithreaded environment. On the other hand, StringBuilder is not synchronized, which makes it faster than StringBuffer, but it is not thread-safe and should not be used in a multithreaded environment

61 There are three main types of variable scope in Java
