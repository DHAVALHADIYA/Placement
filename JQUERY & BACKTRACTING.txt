JQUERY 

-> it's a library of javascript
-> jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
-> jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more"
-> jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
-> here asyncrounis behavior of js used by callbacks;
-> $ == jquery
-> select element -> apply event --> run event
-> $("element").onsubmit(() => {});
-> jquery also used chaining call (one after another event is run in chaining way)

$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $("p").hide();
  });
});




what is backtracking?
it is a algoritham used by java or dsa to solve any problem
for backtracing also recursion is used for solve 

in backtracking we track until condition is not false once condition is false then we do backtrack and solve another way
 
--> backtracking is used to find all the possible solution of the problem
-> all the possible combination is try 
-> based on trial and error concept



----> it may give or not give optimal solution .. that's not gareented that is gives optimal solution 
-> used for find out all possible solution

example :::: N-queens problem
